# Introduction

## Purpose of Project Charter

The Online Virtual Phone System project charter documents and tracks the
necessary information required by decision maker(s) to approve the
project for funding. The project charter should include the needs,
scope, justification, and resource commitment as well as the project's
sponsor(s) decision to proceed or not to proceed with the project. It is
created during the Initiating Phase of the project.

The intended audience of the Online Virtual Phone System project charter is the project sponsor and senior leadership.

# Project And Product Overview

The Online Virtual Phone System is a cloud-based solution that enables users to make calls over the internet without the need for a traditional physical phone line which will compete with Skype. The system will allow users make and recieve call on both their desktop app, mobile app and all from a single business phone number.   

The estimated project duration will be 1 year but Minimum Viable Product will be delivered within 3 months.

The estimated project budget is $500K for the whole project, but only $120K can be spent during first 3 months of the project.

# Justification

## Objectives

The objectives of the Online Virtual Phone System are as follows:

1. Our goal is to create a virtual phone system that will generate $18 million in revenue by the end of the first year of its release. We will do so by charging usage fees and using ad revenue to generate additional income. Increased revenue will allow for additional resources to be implemented to improve customer satisfication via improved performance. 

2. Build a robust and scalable system that allows for a minumum of 10k users to make calls simulatenously as this will allow for users across the country to access and utilize our service and increase profitibility. We expect to have the project completed by October 2024. 

3. Develop a secure and scalable cloud-based solution that allows seamless calling over the internet, with an expected 99.5% uptime. We expect to implement this with deployment of the MVP. This will ensure a high level of customer satisfaction that will improve customer retention and growth. 

## High-Level Requirements

The following table presents the requirements that the project's
product, service or result must meet in order for the project objectives
to be satisfied.

## Major Deliverables

The following table presents the major deliverables that the project's
product, service or result must meet in order for the project objectives
to be satisfied.


## Scope

In-scope: 
We will create mobile applications that will establish and maintain connections between users to facilitate a voice call.
We will create a user interface that will allow users to make a payment from within the application. 

Out-of-scope: 
The project will not involve supplying the servers, hardware or operating systems required to run the system. 
No other forms of communication (ie. video calling, photo sharing, messaging, etc.) will be provided. 
Payment will be routed through a third party to complete the transaction. 
The ability to integrate with any other third party applications, aside from what was previously specified, will not be provided. 

# Duration

## Timeline

The following is the timeline for Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the project with a duration of 13 weeks.

# Assumptions, Constraints And Risks

## Assumptions

This section identifies the statements believed to be true and from
which a conclusion was drawn to define this project charter.

1.  **Client Access:** The client will have provide necessary access to the required 
    for the virtual call system.
2.  **Administrator Access:** Multiple administrators will be able to access the system 
    to manage the system. However, only one administrator will be able to access the system at a time.
3.  **User Privilages:** User privilages are limited to "originate calls" and "receive calls".
4.  **IP Network Reliability:** The IP network will be reliable and sockets are default form of communication.
5.  **Database Reliability:** The database will be reliable and prevent data loss and inconsistencies.
6.  **Billing:** The system will be able to bill the users based on the usage of the system with precision.
7. **Third Parties:** The client will be contacting and responsible to get access to third parties APIs once request has been submitted by project managers.

## Constraints

This section identifies any limitation that must be taken into
consideration prior to the initiation of the project.

1.  **Time Constraints:** The project is constrained to be completed with a time frame of 13 weeks for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and further 1 year for a full system, Any changes to the timeline will be discussed with the client.
2.  **Resource Constraints:** The project is constrained to be completed with a budget of $120K for MVP and $500K for the whole project. Any changes to the budget will be discussed with the client.
3.  **Regulatory and Compliance Constraint:** The system must comply with all the regulatory requirements of the country of deployment.
4.  **IP Network Availability Constraint:** The system relies on the availability of the IP network for communication.
5.  **Scalability Constraint:** The system must be designed to be scalable for future growth.
